<a id="australian-it-association" class="anchor" href="#australian-it-association" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Australian IT Association</h2>

<p>This association is aimed at advancing the interests of IT professionals.</p>

<p>It will based on the good things that other professional associations (such as the Australian Dental Association, Australian Veterinary Association, etc) have done to advance the interests of their professionals, especially recently on the oversupply of professionals.</p>

<p>As a first step, it will be analysed here what other professional associations have done that IT has not.</p>

<p>The Australian Dental Association (ADA) has done a very good analysis of the situation of the occupation of dentist, which can be seen in the submission to the Skilled Occupation List (SOL) review for <a href="http://www.awpa.gov.au/our-work/labour-market-information/skilled-occupation-list/Documents/2014%20SOL%20Submissions/76%20-%20Australian%20Dental%20Association.pdf">2104</a> and <a href="http://www.ada.org.au/App_CmsLib/Media/Lib/1411/M829809_v1_635525128596298953.pdf">2015</a>.</p>

<p>The Australian Computer Society (ACS) has not done a good analysis of the situation of the occupation of IT professional, which can be seen in the submission to Skilled Occupation List (SOL) review for <a href="http://www.awpa.gov.au/our-work/labour-market-information/skilled-occupation-list/Documents/2014%20SOL%20Submissions/64%20-%20Australian%20Computer%20Society.docx">2104</a>. (The one for 2015 is not found on internet)</p>

<p>For example the only two sources that the ACS presented were:</p>
<blockquote><p>"1.) The ICT Statistical Compendium 2012 published by ACS for aggregated data on university enrolments and completions in ICT qualifications. (2013 update to be published shortly).</p>
<p>2.) The 2013 Australian Computer Society Remuneration Survey compiled by the Association of Professional Engineers, Scientists and Managers for data on salary trends by occupation as an indicator of market forces on supply and demand for specific occupations."</p></blockquote> 
<p>But the ADA presented a Supply and Demand analysis and has analysed the number of job applications received for each advertised position.</p>

<p>ADA has kept paying attention to the Graduate Careers Survey several years and has indicated its inconformism with the decline of full-time employment for newly qualified dentists, which has also declined for newly qualified computer science professionals but the ACS has not said anything about it.</p>

<p>ADA undertook a survey asking if graduating dentist have encountered difficulties in obtaining work. The ACS has not referred to that in its submission, implying that it did not do that survey.</p>

<p>ACS has only been dedicated to promoting the idea of skills shortages, for example: 
<a href="http://www.acs.org.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0016/31705/Structural-issues-impacting-ICT-in-the-Australian-Economy-2013.pdf">here</a>
or 
<a href="http://acs.org.au/news-and-media/news/2011/acs-employment-survey-ict-professionals-working-longer-hours,-while-unemployment-rate-remains-unchanged">here</a>
in which it says: "ICT Professionals working longer hours, while unemployment rate remains unchanged".
</p>

<p>But the ACS has been critised before <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/it-pro/business-it/it-profession-deserves-better-than-the-acs-20130206-2dw2y.html">here</a> in which Freelancer.com chief executive and University of Sydney lecturer Matt Barrie said:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Barrie was also furious at the exorbitant fees the ACS charges to certify mainstream Australian university courses for the purposes of immigration. For example, the ACS charges every applicant $425 to certify that courses such as those from Sydney University comply with migration requirements.</p>

<p>I estimate that those and other fees the ACS charges immigrants constitute about half the organisation's income, which raises serious conflict-of-interest questions regarding its promotion of IT immigration.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>I understand that less than 5 per cent of the professional IT workforce belongs to the ACS, and the organisation is universally derided by the profession and industry."</p></blockquote> 

<p>Due to that conflict of interest this Association will give another look at the studies in which the ACS says there are skills shortages and will make the remaining studies that the ACS has not made.</p>

<p>That's important because full-time employment for newly qualified professionals for computer science <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_Australia#2014">has declined since 2011</a>, year after year, and if nothing is done to stop it employment prospects will be very bad.</p>

<h2>Freedom of Information (FOI) request to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO)</h2>
<p>A Freedom of Information (FOI) request was made to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). The ATO was very helpful and provided <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/scgj49cg7dbz56r/IT%20jobs%20-%2016%20Jan%202015.pdf?dl=0">this PDF document</a> with the list of IT jobs advertised since 2008, the number of people that applied to them and how many of them were considered suitable to do the job.</p>
<p>You can request copies of it from ATO as they explain it in <a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/About-ATO/Access,-accountability-and-reporting/In-detail/FOI/Freedom-of-information-disclosure-log/?page=1#How_to_obtain_a_document_mentioned_in_the_disclosure_log">this page</a>. It has the FOI Request No. 1-68SAJB0 from 30 January 2015.</p>
<p>Based on that document the following scatter charts were created:</p>

<p>The charts are analysed in this way: The trend of the average is going up and there is the presence of extreme points in recent years.</p>
