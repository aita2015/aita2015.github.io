<a id="australian-it-association" class="anchor" href="#australian-it-association" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Australian IT Association</h3>

<p>This association is aimed at advancing the interests of IT professionals.</p>

<p>It will based on the good things that other professional associations (such as the Australian Dental Association, Australian Veterinary Association, etc) have done to advance the interests of their professionals, especially recently on the oversupply of professionals.</p>

<p>As a first step, it will be analysed here what other professional associations have done that IT has not.</p>

<p>The Australian Dental Association (ADA) has done a very good analysis of the situation of the occupation of dentist, which can be seen in the submission to the Skilled Occupation List (SOL) review for <a href="http://www.awpa.gov.au/our-work/labour-market-information/skilled-occupation-list/Documents/2014%20SOL%20Submissions/76%20-%20Australian%20Dental%20Association.pdf">2104</a> and <a href="http://www.ada.org.au/App_CmsLib/Media/Lib/1411/M829809_v1_635525128596298953.pdf">2015</a>.</p>

<p>The Australian Computer Society (ACS) has not done a good analysis of the situation of the occupation of IT professional, which can be seen in the submission to Skilled Occupation List (SOL) review for <a href="http://www.awpa.gov.au/our-work/labour-market-information/skilled-occupation-list/Documents/2014%20SOL%20Submissions/64%20-%20Australian%20Computer%20Society.docx">2104</a>. (The one for 2015 is not found on internet)</p>

<p>For example the only two sources that the ACS presented were:</p>
<p>"1.) The ICT Statistical Compendium 2012 published by ACS for aggregated data on university enrolments and completions in ICT qualifications. (2013 update to be published shortly).</p>
<p>2.) The 2013 Australian Computer Society Remuneration Survey compiled by the Association of Professional Engineers, Scientists and Managers for data on salary trends by occupation as an indicator of market forces on supply and demand for specific occupations."</p>
<p>But the ADA presented a Supply and Demand analysis and has analysed the number of applications received for each advertised position.</p>
